If "help text" is enabled, there will be a question mark %s placed next to the input field. Hovering over this question mark will show the help text. If both Begin Date and End Date are left blank, all submissions will be displayed. If this box is checked, Ninja Forms will clear the form after it has been successfully submitted. If this box is checked, Ninja Forms will hide the form after it has been successfully submitted. If this box is checked, Ninja Forms will send a copy of this form (and any messages attached) to this address. If this box is checked, Ninja Forms will validate this input as an email address. If this box is checked, both password and re-password textboxes will be output. If you want to include field data entered by the user, for instance a name, you can use the following shortcode: [ninja_forms_field id=23] where 23 is the ID of the field you want to insert. This will tell Ninja Forms to replace the bracketed text with whatever input the user placed in that field. You can find the field ID when you expand the field for editing. If you want to send an empty value, you can use '' for the value. If your form is submitted via ajax, what message should appear to let users know it is being processed?
