Creates functionality to duplicate any and all post types, including taxonomies & custom fields.

== Description ==

This plugin was created to make an exact duplicate of a selected post. Custom post types are supported, along with custom taxonomies and custom fields.

*Note: Comments are not passed to the new post.

This plugin is simply meant to quickly and easily duplicate a post. Just hover over a post in the edit screen and select 'Duplicate {post_type}' to create a duplicate post.

I created this plugin mainly for myself when I'm develping WordPress sites. I always need dummy content to fill out the look of a website and wanted a very quick and easy way to create multiple posts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `m4c-postduplicator` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
