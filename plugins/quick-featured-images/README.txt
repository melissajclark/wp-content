Your time-saving Swiss Army Knife for featured images: Set, replace and delete them in bulk, set default images, get overview lists.

== Description ==

= Manage featured images quickly =

The plugin 'Quick Featured Images' helps you bulk managing featured images, setting automatic default featured images to save your time. 

1. It **sets, replaces and removes featured images for hundreds of posts, pages and custom post types in one go**. You can run it over all contens or let it work only to desired contents by using flexible filters.
2. It displays assigned features images in an **extra image column in lists of posts, pages and custom post types** if they support thumbnails. So you get a quick overview about used thumbnails of all posts and pages.
3. It enables you to **define presets for automatic default featured images** for future posts as many as you need. You can set **accurate rules based on post properties**.

= Access =

1. You will find the plugin under the own **menu item 'Featured Images'** 
2. You can select an image in the media library with the **action link 'Bulk set as featured image'**. Click on it and you can go on with the plugin.

= Set, replace, remove: Actions =

With Quick Featured Images you can apply time-saving tasks with many featured images: add, exchange and delete them in bulk.

1. **Adding featured images:** You can select an image or scan for the first post image to set it as the new featured image to hundreds of posts in one go. You can select multiple images to set them randomly as featured images.
2. **Exchanging featured images:** You can replace or update several existing featured images with a selected image in one go.
3. **Deleting featured images:** You can remove a selected featured image or all existing featured images in one go.

= Set, replace, remove: Options =

You can switch between 

1. **overwriting existing featured images** or 
2. **keeping them unchanged**. 

The latter setting is the default.

= Set, replace, remove: Filters =

If there would be no filters Quick Featured Images would affect all posts and pages without exception! In most cases this is not desired. 

The implemented filters allow you to narrow down the action to only the posts and pages you want to modify. The built-in filters are:

1. Filter by **post type**: Search by post types. By **default all** posts, pages and custom post types will be affected
2. Filter by **status**: Search by several statuses (published, draft, private etc.). By **default all** statuses will be affected
3. Filter by **search**: Search by search term
4. Filter by **time**: Search by time specifications
5. Filter by **author**: Search by author
6. Filter by **custom taxonomy**: Search by terms of registered taxonomies of a plugin or a theme
7. Filter by **featured image size**: Search for small featured images below a given size
8. Filter by **category**: Search posts by category
9. Filter by **tag**: Search posts by tag
10. Filter by **parent page**: Search child pages by parent page

= Automatic Default Featured Images =

**You can set rules for default featured images of posts easily.** Every time you insert a new post or save an existing post Quick Featured Images will look for a rule to add and to change the preset featured image to the saved post. 

You can define the rules based on

1. always the **first content image**
2. post **categories**
3. post **tags**
4. post **authors**
5. **standard post types** 'Post' and 'Page'
6. all other **custom post types** supporting featured images
7. all other **custom taxonomies** supporting featured images

The rules are easy to set: choose an image, a taxonomy, a value and save the settings. That's it. **You do not need to code.**

You can add, change and delete every rule whenever you want. So you get an **unlimited and precise set of rules** for automatic default featured images in your website.

= Additional columns in posts lists =

Quick Featured Images adds a column in posts lists. The additional column shows the currently assigned featured image of each post. With that you can get a **quick overview about all used images**. You can also see posts with no featured image at a glance.

Under **'Featured Images'** &gt; **'Image Columns'** you can switch on and off the additional image column for every single post type, even custom post types if they support thumbnails.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I set a default featured image for existing posts? =

For that use the plugin twice:

1. Under 'Set, replace, delete' **remove** all undesired featured images if there are some. If desired remove the images using the option 'Overwrite existing featured images'.
2. Then choose the desired image and **set** it to the posts **without the option 'Overwrite existing featured images'**. This will set the image to all posts without a featured image.

= How can I set a default featured image for future posts? =

**Or: I want image X as default featured image if the post has category Y. How to set this?**

Look at some examples:

1. To set a default featured image for every new post of the category 'Lorem ipsum':
	1. choose the image
	2. choose the taxonomy 'Category' and
	3. choose the value 'Lorem ipsum'.
	4. save the settings.
2. To set a default featured image for every new post: 
	1. choose the image
	2. choose the taxonomy 'Post Type' and
	3. choose the value 'Post'
	4. save the settings.
3. To set a default featured image for every new custom taxonomy of a theme or a plugin, e.g. events of the category 'Concert':
	1. choose the image
	2. choose the taxonomy 'Event Category' and
	3. choose the value 'Concert'.
	4. save the settings.

= Who can see Quick Featured Images in the WordPress backend? =

All users who have the right to **edit others posts** have the access to Quick Featured Images. As long as the user roles are untouched after a fresh standard WordPress installation both **Administrators** and **Editors** can use this plugin.

For these users the menu item 'Featured Images' with its sub pages appears in the WordPress backend. All other users will not see this menu item or will get an error message if they would request a Quick Featured Images page via a direct link.

= Does the plugin work in a WordPress Multisite installation? =

Yes. It works either activated for all sites (network wide) or activated in each single site. It changes only the posts of the site where you use it.

= Why does the plugin say "No matches found" after confirmation? =

This could be the case if the images were not uploaded via WordPress' own media uploader. If you have uploaded images via FTP or other ways the plugin can not find images.

It does not matter where the images are stored on your server. They can be in any folder. But they have to be uploaded via WordPress' own media uploader to be found by this plugin. If this is the case the plugin will work fine.

= Why are there sometimes strange search results with custom taxonomies? =

The search for custom taxonomy terms could lead to surprising results. The reason is custom taxonomies can be used in many different ways. It is not possible to catch them all in one single code expression. If you should be unsatisfied with the result try other filters to get the result you want.

= Which languages does the plugin support? =

Actually these languages are supported:

* English
* German

Further translations are welcome. If you want to give in your translation please leave a notice in the [plugin's support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/quick-featured-images).

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

If you want to contribute a translation of the plugin in your language it would be great! You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.
